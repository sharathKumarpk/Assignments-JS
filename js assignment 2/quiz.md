# 1. What are the variable naming conventions in JavaScript?
# ans.-Variables are case sensitive.
# - Variables can be single character or multi character or alphaneumeric.
# - Spaces are not allowed in variable names.
# - Only letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs are permitted in variable names.
# - Case matters when it comes to variable names.
# - A letter (alphabet), an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($) must be the first character in a variable name, any other special characters must not be taken.
# - certain terms such as reserved words in javascript shouldn’t be used to name variables.

# 2. Create a greeting alert (use => prompt, message, alert)
# Ans: let yourName=prompt("Enter your name")
# alert("Hello" + " " +yourName +"!"+" " + "Welcome" + " "+"to"+" "+ "our"+" "+ "website.")

# 3.Write some code so that the values of the below variables switch around 
# Let fish = “fly”, let bird = “swim”. Switch the value so that fish holds the value “swim” and the variable bird holds the value “fly”
```js
let fish = ("fly")
let bird = ("swim")
let c = bird
fish = c
console.log (fish)
console.log(bird)
```
